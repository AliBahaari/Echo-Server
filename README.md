# Echo Server

"Echo Server" is a simple socket echo server written by Node.js, Express and Express-WS for testing socket programming.

## Usage
First, you should connect to `localhost:4000/echo`.
Then, you should see the message below:
> "Connected, now send me a message to echo it."

After connecting, when you send any message to the server, it returns the same message you've sent to it.

Also check `localhost:4000` which is a simple `GET` HTTP method which returns some information about the project and myself.
